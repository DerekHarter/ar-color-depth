# Reproducible Research and Open Science

This project follows princiiples of reproducible research and
open science. A few good general resources to learn more about
the principles and best practices of open reproducable research:

This project repository strives to support reprodcible research
and open science in many of the ways outlined in the above resources.

- The project code is open source, all code used for data analysis
  and collecting data is stored and viewable in this open repository.
- This project data is open data /  open access.  All raw data is collected in this
  project so that reanalysis and replication from collected data may be
  performed by any researcher.
- Documentation of software tools, versions and environments is part of this
  repository so that anyone may recreate the environemnt and (re)run all of the
  experiments, tools and data analysis collected in this project.
- This project repository strives for a reproducible workflow.  No data analysis
  products or tools are performed by hand.  All parts of the workflow of this
  project, from the raw data to final papers, can be fully reproduced by
  running the project workflow contained in this repository.
